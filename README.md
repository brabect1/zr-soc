Simple SoC with RISC-V Ibex Core
================================

This project implements a simple, experimental SoC built on the [Ibex](https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex)
core. Peripheral subsystem was taken (and partially cleaned up) from [e200_opensource](https://github.com/SI-RISCV/e200_opensource)
and once was compatible with SiFive's Freedom SoC (present compatibility is unknown).
